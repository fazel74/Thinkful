1) You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in 
   February and the other in May

Initial design: A/B Testing
Bias: Time periods of sending email
Assumption: The result of this test cannot clearly provide a good scale of comparison because the two groups of 
email were sent in two different time periods. The number of potential customers for each of these time periods 
may differ because they received email in different seasons. People purchase bathing suit more in a warm season 
than others.  

2) You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the 
   general population.
   
Initial design: A/A Testing
Bias: Convenient Sampling
Assumption: Patients who visit the clinic already have anxiety, and the sampling method is not appropriate to 
conclude the result for the general population.

3) You launch a new ad billboard-based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
   Initial design: A/B Testing
Bias: we cannot be sure If there is just one connection between visiting website and the new ad.
Assumptions: there might be other reasons that people are visiting the website more. We also should consider 
other factors.

4) You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
Initial design: A/B Testing
Bias: A loyalty program is usually for existence customers
Assumption: checking to have a higher number of website visitors might not be a good way if the loyalty program 
works. Another program to get new customers’ attention may have a different result.
