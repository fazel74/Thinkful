DRILL:
Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their 
bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities,
and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be 
useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

Answer:
First of all we need to detrmine how our model will predict the outcome. The payment staus can be checked, and
1 and 0 can be assigned respectively for on time and not on time bills paid. 
Because there are purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment,
we need to normalize them by z-scores to make unique scale of data. We also can give weights based on how long
the credit card user has used the card. The observation will be more reliable if the credit card has been used 
longer by a person. Finally, we can give input to our model to predict the outcome.
