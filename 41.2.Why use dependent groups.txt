1. Sucial behavior survey: Doing the same survery in years and possibly collection answers from the same participants to measure differences in answers between different years.

2. Sport teams Popularity: Studying sports teams popularity by doing surveys in years or league seasons from theirs fans. 

3. So many others studies in which it is important to know the changes during time.
