
The Research Proposal

"The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective."

The problem
How to increase number of converted droids to the dark side? If droids don't convert to the dark side, it means
that there is a potential possibility to become favorable toward the Jedi. It will decrease the power of the Sith Lords
in the Galaxy.


The Potential Solution

Changing the current recruiting slogan to a more effective one. An effective slogan is very important to achieve the goal, 
and droids mostly respond positive when they are impacted by a good and effective slogan.


The method of testing the solution

First we determine two effective slogans; we can choose the current slogan, and another new slogan, or both new.
Now we attentively make two group samples to be similar in number, distribution, and chatacteristics of droids, in other words 
to have them randomized as much as possible. Then we deliver the messages with each slogans to its target group. To track the
effectiveness of the slogans, we count the positive results of messages back. If the number of converted droids for a slogan 
is pretty much higher than the other, we can conclude that that slogan is more effective, and continue recruiting with that slogan.
If there is no signifcant difference between the results, we should repeat the experience with two new groups and change both or one
of the slogans.
