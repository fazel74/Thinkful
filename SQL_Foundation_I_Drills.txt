14) Write a query that returns all the records of vehicles since the year 2000 
whose model name starts with a capital X. Sort the list A through Z by make. 
What happens when you use a lowercase “x” instead?

SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE year >= 2000 AND model LIKE 'X%'
ORDER BY make;

& 

SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE year >= 2000 AND model LIKE 'x%'
ORDER BY make;

The results are very different.(469 vs. 40)
