Challenge: Which model?

You now have a fairly substantial starting toolbox of supervised learning methods that you can use to tackle a host of 
exciting problems. To make sure all of these ideas are organized in your mind, please go through the list of problems below.
For each, identify which supervised learning method(s) would be best for addressing that particular problem. Explain your
reasoning and discuss your answers with your mentor.

1.Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics.
- Regression; it seems that data follows a pattern; a linear regression could be a good model.  


2.You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.
- Decision Tree might be a good model, but all depends on meaning of the data. We probably need to run some data transformation 
and feature selection methods.


3.Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.
- SVM, or better than that a gradient boosting model is capable to determine the importance.


4.Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient
- This is a classification. Naive Bayse can be used like spam classifier.


5.You have 1000+ features.
- We need feature selection more than anything else. To choose a model, we need more information about data. A regression
or decision tree model might be useful.


6.Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.
- This is a classification. We can use random forest of decision tree classifire as a model.


7.Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500
- We need feature selection and to determine hyperparameter. A regression model might be a good model.


8.Identify faces in an image.
- Face rcognition needs to work on a high volume of data. SVM might be a good model for this problem.


9.Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.
- This is another classification. Random forest might be a good model.
