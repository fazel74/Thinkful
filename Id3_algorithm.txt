Algorithm(Observations, Outcome, Attributes)
    Create a root node.
    If all observations are 'A', label root node 'A' and return.
    If all observations are 'B', label root node 'B' and return.
    If no attributes return the root note labeled with the most common Outcome.
    Otherwise, start:
        For each value vi of each attribute ai, calculate the entropy.
        The attribute ai and value vi with the lowest entropy is the best rule.
        The attribute for this node is then ai
            Split the tree to below based on the rule ai = vi
            Observationsvi is the subset of observations with value vi
            If Observationsvi is empty cap with node labeled with most common Outcome
            Else at the new node start a subtree (Observationsvi, Target Outcome, Attributes - {ai}) and repeat the algorithm
